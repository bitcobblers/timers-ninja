## Timers.Ninja

# How-To:

At the heart of Timers.Ninja is the philosophy that editing text is easier than navigating some user interface. **A few short key strokes and boom!!!** Timers are ready to go.

### The Basics

Each with a number is a timer. The example bellow, is timer that will count up to 10. Go head, give it a try in the code editor on the right. Just clear the window to return here.

```
10
```

Similarly, adding a negative symbol before the value will result in a count down timer instead and the label after the number inside parentheses results in a `warm up` label on the timer.

```
-10:00(warm up)
```

### Labels & Multipliers

Lets face it, if just typing numbers on lines
